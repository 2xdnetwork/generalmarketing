<p><span style="font-weight: 200;">If you learn that anyone younger than 18 has provided us with personal data, please contact us and if we have reason to believe that we hold personal data of a person under that age in our databases, we will delete that personal data.</span></p><br>

<h2 class="da-service__title ">Who “We” Are</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 200;">When we refer to “we” (“our” or “us”), we mean {{$app->request->get('api_name')}}, websites. We are headquartered in the United States.</span></p><br>


<h2 class="da-service__title ">How We Collect Your Data</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 200;">When you visit our websites or purchase services, we collect personal data. The ways we collect it can be broadly categorized into the following:</span></p>
<p><b>Information you provide to us directly:</b><span style="font-weight: 200;"> When you visit or use some parts of our websites and/or services we might ask you to provide personal data. For example, we ask for your contact information when you interact with us on social media, contact us with questions or request support. If you don’t want to provide us with personal data, you don’t have to, but it might mean you can’t use some parts of our websites or services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 200;">The Table located at the end of this Privacy Policy sets out the categories of personal data you provide to us and that we receive from other sources and how we use that information. The table also lists the legal basis which we rely on to process the personal information and information as to how we determine applicable retention periods.</span></p>
<p><b>Information we collect automatically: </b><span style="font-weight: 200;">We collect some information about you automatically when you visit our websites or use our services, like your IP address and device type. We also collect information when you navigate through our websites and services, including what pages you looked at and what links you clicked on. This information is useful for us as it helps us get a better understanding of how you’re using our websites and services so that we can continue to provide the best experience possible (e.g., by customizing content).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 200;">Some of this information is collected using cookies and similar tracking technologies. If you want to find out more about the types of cookies we use, why, and how you can control them, please view our </span><span style="font-weight: 200;">Cookie Notice</span><span style="font-weight: 200;">.</span></p>
<p><b>Information we get from third parties:</b><span style="font-weight: 200;"> The majority of information we collect directly from you. Sometimes we might collect personal data about you from other sources, such as publicly available materials or trusted third parties like our marketing and research partners. We use this information to supplement the personal data we already hold about you, in order to better inform, personalize and improve our services, and to validate the personal data you provide.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 200;">Where we collect personal data, we’ll only process it:</span></p><br>

<div class="tp-da-about-fea pb-25 mb-10">
<ul>
<li><span><i class="fal fa-check"></i></span>to perform a contract with you, or</li>

<br>
<h2 class="da-service__title ">How We Share Your Data</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 200;">There will be times when we need to share your personal data with third parties. We will only disclose your personal data to:</span></p><br>

<ul>
<li><span><i class="fal fa-check"></i></span>third party service providers and partners who assist and enable us to use the personal data to, for example, provide functionality on the website or support delivery of services, or to market or promote our goods and services to you</li>

</ul>
</div>


<br>
<h2 class="da-service__title ">International Data Transfers</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 200;">We may transfer the personal data we collect about you to recipients in countries other than the country you live in, including the United States, where we are headquartered. These countries may not have the same data protection laws as the country in which you initially provided the information. </span><span style="font-weight: 200;">Rest assured, where we disclose personal data to a third party in another country, we put safeguards in place to ensure your personal data remains protected; as described </span><span style="font-weight: 200;">in this privacy policy, or as disclosed to you at the time of data collection.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 200;">For individuals in the European Economic Area (</span><b>EEA</b><span style="font-weight: 200;">), your data may be transferred outside of the EEA. Where your personal data is transferred outside the EEA, it will only be transferred to countries that have been identified as providing adequate protection for EEA data or to a third party where we have approved transfer mechanisms in place to protect your personal data – i.e., by entering into the European Commission’s </span><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/model-contracts-transfer-personal-data-third-countries_en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 200;">Standard Contractual Clauses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 200;">, or by ensuring the entity is </span><a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 200;">Privacy Shield certified</span></a><span style="font-weight: 200;"> (for transfers to US-based third parties).

<h2 class="da-service__title ">Retention</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 200;">The length of time we keep your personal data depends on what it is and whether we have an ongoing business need to retain it (for example, to provide you with a service you’ve requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 200;">We’ll retain your personal data for as long as we have a relationship with you and for a period of time afterwards where we have an ongoing business need to retain it, in accordance with our data retention policies and practices.

<br><h2 class="da-service__title ">What cookies/tracking technologies do we use?</h2>
<p>A cookie is a small text file that’s placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit one of our website. We, and some of our affiliates and third-party service providers, use a few different types of cookies. Some are persistent cookies (cookies that remain on your hard drive for an extended period of time) and some are session ID cookies (cookies that expire when you close your browser).</p>
<p>Both websites and HTML emails may also contain other tracking technologies such as “web/tracking beacons”, “pixels”, or “clear gifs” and local storage. These are typically small transparent images that provide us with statistics, for similar purposes as cookies, such as when someone has visited our website or opened an email we have sent them. They are often used in conjunction with cookies, though they are not stored on your computer in the same way. As a result, if you disable cookies, web beacons may still load, but their functionality will be restricted.</p>

<p>They assist us in operating our website and services, enhance and customize your experience across our website and services, perform analytics and deliver advertising and marketing that’s relevant to you.</p>
<p>There are also cookies set by third parties across our website and services.
