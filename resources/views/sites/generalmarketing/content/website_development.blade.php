Responsive website designs are designs that are fluid, meaning that they are built to expand, contract and resize images based upon the browser we detect that is viewing the website. Responsive designs allow our websites to perform well and look great whether the user is browsing your site from a desktop, tablet, laptop, retina-ready display, or mobile device.</p>      
                           <p class="mb-0 pb-20 wow tpfadeUp" data-wow-delay=".3s">The best part of a responsive fluid design for your website, is that you no longer need mobile websites. Mobile sites tend to have completely different content and navigation. With a responsive website design, all users will have full access to all of your content every time. You will not have to support two separate websites thanks to Responsive Websites from {{$app->request->get('api_name')}}!</p>
