<br><h2 class="da-service__title ">We Love Transparency, Honesty, and Integrity.</h2>
<p>That’s why we have this posted publicly. So kick back and enjoy reading our Standard Terms of Service that applies to anyone hiring us</p>

<p></p>
<p>You&nbsp;are hiring us&nbsp;{{$app->request->get('api_name')}}&nbsp;located at {{$app->request->get('api_address')}}. Of course it’s a little more complicated, but we’ll get to that.</p>


<br><h2 class="da-service__title ">Billing</strong></h2>

<p>Assets and work we complete remain the property of {{$app->request->get('api_name')}} until payment is made in full. &nbsp;Once payment in full is received, all work completed by {{$app->request->get('api_name')}} will be released under a work-for-hire agreement excepting any open-source, licensed, or prior-owned assets or code used in production. Unapproved drafts, mockups, strategies and other creative work performed stays with us unless requested and paid for additionally. Due to the nature of our work, dozens, if not hundreds of various file types can be created for each asset. It’s your responsibility to tell us what formats you need them in at the time of final payment. &nbsp;If you don’t specify, we’ll provide them in one of a few standard formats. &nbsp;Requests for files or additional formats at a later date may incur additional cost.</p>
<p>Payment for ongoing services such as, but not limited to, an Agency of Record retainer, website hosting, call tracking phone services, domain name registrations, email hosting, software/service licenses, software development and media buying must remain current for services to continue. Nonpayment will result in suspension of these services.&nbsp; Transfer access to these services will not be granted until payment is made in full including all late fees.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to suspend all services in the event of nonpayment for one or more other services we provide. On receipt of payment in full, services will be reactivated. We reserve the right to charge a reasonable reactivation fee for each service in question.</p>
<p>Media expenses will be paid up front before the media campaigns are activated (or paid directly to the vendor as necessary). For ongoing media campaigns, estimated monthly media costs will be billed at the beginning of the month. The first month’s media expenses must be received before the campaign begins.</p>
<p>Payment for media expenses must remain current for campaigns to remain online. It is understood and agreed that the payment requirements of suppliers are such that you&nbsp;must cooperate so we&nbsp;can pay commitments promptly and maintain its recognition and good credit standing.</p>
<p>A service charge of 1-1/2% (18% per annum) will be charged on all sums not paid within a 30-day period after due date of invoice or service receipt.

Under no circumstances will we&nbsp;be obligated to breach any contractual commitment to others.</p>
<p>Once&nbsp;services&nbsp;are ended and after we receive payment for all outstanding invoices, we’ll transfer, assign and make available to you all property and materials in our&nbsp;possession or control belonging to you. If services are cancelled and it takes a lot of additional work for us to get you copies of stuff, we reserve the right to bill for the time it takes to get you&nbsp;the stuff you need.</p>

Finally, if any provision of this agreement shall be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from this contract and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.</p>
